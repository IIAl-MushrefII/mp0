          <p>
            I’m a senior in Computer Science at UIUC with a focus on
            cybersecurity and systems. During my free time, I like to play CTFs,
            HackTheBox, and TryHackMe, where I practice offensive techniques and
            sharpen problem-solving under pressure. I like understanding how
            attacks really work and then applying that knowledge to build
            stronger defenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy coffee — usually a double shot of espresso
            or a cortado — and biking around campus to clear my head.
